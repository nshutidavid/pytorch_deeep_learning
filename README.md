# PyTorch Deep Learning Notes & Projects  

This repository contains my learning journey through the **first part of a PyTorch Deep Learning course**, where I explored the fundamentals of PyTorch, building workflows, classification tasks, computer vision basics, and working with custom datasets.  

The structure of this repo closely follows the excellent [PyTorch Deep Learning](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning) materials created by [Daniel Bourke (mrdbourke)](https://github.com/mrdbourke). I acknowledge his work as the foundation and inspiration for this repository.
